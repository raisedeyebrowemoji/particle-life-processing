# Particle Life (now in Processing)
Same thing but now written almost entirely **myself** and in a **faster engine** and with a working **config file**. 

*Made in 2.5 days.*


## INSTRUCTIONS: 
* c to reimport config (imports all these settings, applies some immediately)
* s to respawn particles (if config was reimported, applies number of types and paricles)
* r to randomize interations (if config was reimported, applies randomiser limits)
* press in this order to reimport these settings completely
* figure it out yourself lmao
