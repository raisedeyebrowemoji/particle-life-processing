# Particle Life (now in Processing)
Same thing but now written almost entirely **myself** and in a **faster engine** and with a working **config file**. 

*Made in 2.5 days.*


## INSTRUCTIONS: 
* press c to reimport [C]onfig (imports all these settings, applies some immediately)
* press s to re[S]pawn particles (if config was reimported, applies number of types and particles)
* press r to [R]andomize interations (if config was reimported, applies randomizer limits)
* press in this order to reimport all settings
* figure it out yourself lmao
